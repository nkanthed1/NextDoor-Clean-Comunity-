            <h1>Report Pieces of Vandilism Here</h1>
            <p>We at NSS saw this problem in every community we have lived in. Recently our school went in-person and pieces of vandalism spiked drastically. Causing us to think of a way to fix this. We thought of a form which once filled out would automatically send an email or text message to city council that corresponds with where you found the piece of vandalism. This would help the community because then the piece of vandalism would be taken down much faster.
