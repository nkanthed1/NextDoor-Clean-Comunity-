            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We at NSS are a group of High school students from the bay area. Who are all passionate coders who like to make whatever interests us. Our products range from small simple game applications 
                all the way to data analytics and social change 
                software. We like to try out new things every 
                time we create so that we can learn more and have fun.
                 Our favorite languages or modules to use are python, pandas, HTML, CSS, and pygame. But we would like to expand our breadth of knowledge further. The program you are making is one of our more serious ideas with a lot of meaning behind it. We noticed that there has been a 
                 lot of hate crime vandalization in our area. We also noticed that many times these hate crimes arenâ€™t taken down because no one reports them. So we made Clean Community. A place to report vandalism easily.</p>
